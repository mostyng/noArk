		President Bush visited a Capitol Supermarket on Tuesday afternoon, for the unveiling of the country's completely automated self-checkout counter for public use in a retail store. Crowds of hundreds gathered in amazement to witness the futuristic technology being used for the first time. </p><!-- </marquee> -->
		<p>
		These machines were invented by Fujitsu Ltd, a multinational technology company. "We're honored to have such an amazing public reception. We're very proud of these machines." Said the CFO of Fujitsu, who was present at the unveiling and appeared in a photo-op with President Bush. "Fujitsu is excited to continue being the future of technology and animation to the world. </p>

		<p>
		 	This celebration was not free of pessimism. Members of the staff of Capitol Supermarket were on strike during the ceremony, claiming that the innovation will hurt their careers. "I've worked behind the counter here for seven years," said Martha Jones, 54, "now my shifts are being cut in half because the suits upstairs want to hire these robots? How is that fair?! I have three children to feed!"

			In what Ford motor company is calling a "major step forward in innovation," 80% of workers in their largest automobile manufacturing plant in the United States are being replaced by automated machinery imported from Japan. "This is the future of building cars." Said Ford CEO, Mark Fields. "This major change will increase production speed, assure quality and lower prices."</p>
			<p>
			The Ford factory in southern Detroit has been one of the largest employers in the city for the last decade. With the decline of vehicle production in the U.S. this claims to be a step to get Ford back to the economic powerhouse that it was in the mid to late 1900's.</p>
			<p>
			A ribbon cutting for the updated factory was planned for December 3rd, but a protest by newly unemployed factory workers forced it to be canceled. Hundreds of men and women congregated in front of the factory where the press conference and ribbon cutting was planned, holding their pink slips above their heads and chanting in unison to protest the mass termination. </p>

			<p>
			"It's clear that changes need to be made at this factory, as it's been in decline for the last decade, but this is not the way to go about it." Said Tyler Swann, who was approaching his 30th year of work at the factory. "This may help the executives of Ford, but is a complete insult to the hard working men and women of Detroit. We can't be replaced by mechanical arms!"

				<p>In yet another controversial press conference by the ride-sharing service Uber, their CEO Travis Kalanick announced this morning that the company will put its first fleet of completely automated, self-driving cars in use later this week. “Uber proud to announce the future of taxi service.” said Kalanick. “We’re excited to have the public experience the ease and convenience of our new driverless vehicles. </p>
				<p>Uber has been making headlines for years in it’s controversial treatment of it’s drivers, including not giving customers the options to tip, but in a shocking announcement late last night, Kalanick is removing human drivers from their business model altogether, claiming they are “unnecessary.”</p>
				<p>
				These drivers were not pleased with this mass-termination with no warning. As a sign of protest, hundreds of (former) drivers for uber parked outside Uber headquarters on W27th street in Manhattan, and eventually created a roadblock, causing a complete standstill on the West Side Highway. At 4:00pm bystanders likened the event to the protest held outside JFK international airport and President Trump (before his impeachment) after his controversial executive order banning entry to 8 countries in the Middle East.</p>
				<p>However, by 8pm, the protest turned into a full-fledged riot, as cars outside the Uber building were flipped on their side and set on fire. Trash cans were thrown into windows and the uber sign was ripped from the building. </p>
